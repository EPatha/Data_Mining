# Decision Tree Model Output

## Description

In this project, we perform data analysis using a decision tree model. The output of this model illustrates how decisions are made based on the attributes present in the preprocessed dataset.

## Preprocessing Steps

Before building the decision tree model, we undertook a series of preprocessing steps on the data:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant or duplicate entries.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Filled in missing values using appropriate imputation methods.
3. **Categorical Encoding**: Converted categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
4. **Normalization/Standardization**: Applied normalization or standardization to numerical features to enhance model performance.
